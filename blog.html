            <h1>Why My Study Choice: ICT</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I chose ICT as my field of study due to my deep-seated interest in technology and its
                    transformative impact on the world. My motivation stems from a fervent desire to be at the
                    forefront of innovation, utilizing cutting-edge tools and knowledge to solve real-world
                    challenges, and contributing to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.</p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h3>Strengths</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I learn pretty fast and create good relationships with people very fast, also when I
                                like something I dedicate myself at 100%.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I'll learn from experienced individuals and use my analytical thinking to apply what
                                I learn effectively.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Get frustrated easily if things don't go the way I plan, also I tend to overthink
                                stuff.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Threats</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Honestly the thing i'm most scared of is having time to do everything i want to.
                                I'm also afraid (since i'm a bit older than most) that i won't be able to create a
                                bond with my future colleagues.</li>

                <h2>Goal and Plan for the Future</h2>
                <p>My goal would be to open my start-up during college, meaning that once I get out I could dedicate
                    myself to my business 200%.
                    If my main idea doesn't work out I would like to work in data science (mainly for the money paid
                    in the area) or grow within a company until I become one of the leaders of a department, because
                    I don't see myself in the future taking orders from too many people.
                    I plan to learn mainly programming languages, web development and in the third year I plan to
                    follow business IT Consultant or data science, it will all depend on what happens in between.

                <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
                <p>I'm starting my coding journey from scratch with no prior experience. My commitment to learning,
                    practice, and problem-solving drives me to transform into a proficient coder, driven by a
                    passion for technology and innovation.</p>

                <h2>Feedback</h2>
                <p class="feedback">
                    Your motivation to open a business is admirable, and IT indeed can be very helpful in that,
                    however, we are searching for the motivation you have to learn and pursue a career in IT, why
                    does that interest you? Why you think this will be a good match for your business in the future?
                    What will be its goal? The porpuse in finding your motivation is to help you continue and
                    succeed in your studies.

                    When looking at your goals after completing the studies they are very impressive, and it is
                    noticeable you have high goals. But again, I invite you to search more about the IT jobs and
                    roles that may interest you, and why they would be a good fit for you, besides the potential
                    salary.

                    Looking at your personal analysis, it is noticeable you are aware of some of your main strengths
                    and weaknesses, this is very good. Your dedication and openness to new connections will come in
                    very handy and useful during your studies, especially with group projects. I recommend you check
                    what may help you handle situations where the outcomes will not be exactly what youll wish them
                    to be, as this will happen especially when studying, doing exams, or working on group tasks. It
                    is good you see the potential as well behind overthinking and not only as negativity, but it
                    could also come handy to find an activity or exercise that will help you calm those extra
                    thoughts for your mental peace. Concerning your fears, please don't worry about your age, there
                    will be others around the same age, and you will be surprised how easily youll connect with
                    others even if you are of different ages (talking from experience).

                    <summary class="h3"> Feedback (my thoughts) </summary>
                    <td>
                        <p class="feedback"> In relation to the feedback, the main reason why i think ICT is a good
                            match to open a business in the future is because with programming i can create stuff from
                            nothing and this course will allow me to develop my skills to become a programmer in the
                            future and create a vision that will come.
                            <br>
                            I haven't given much thought about future jobs that i will do, i want to first start
                            learning things and then come to a conclusion on what i liked and didn't like.
