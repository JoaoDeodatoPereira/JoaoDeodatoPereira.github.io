            <h2>Goal and Plan for the Future</h2>
            <p>My goal would be to open my start-up during college, meaning that once I get out I could dedicate myself to my business 200%.
              If my main idea doesn't work out I would like to work in data science (mainly for the money paid in the area) or grow within a company until I become one of the leaders of a department, because I don't see myself in the future taking orders from too many people.
              I plan to learn mainly programming languages, web development and in the third year I plan to follow business IT Consultant or data science, it will all depend on what happens in between.</p>

            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p class="feedback">Welcome João Guilherme Deodato Pereira,

              Thank you for submitting your “Who Am I?” form. The feedback given here is for you to use when you start the program, so you don’t have to respond to it just now.
              
              Your motivation to open a business is admirable, and IT indeed can be very helpful in that, however, we are searching for the motivation you have to learn and pursue a career in IT, why does that interest you? Why you think this will be a good match for your business in the future? What will be its goal? The porpuse in finding your motivation is to help you continue and succeed in your studies.
              
              When looking at your goals after completing the studies they are very impressive, and it is noticeable you have high goals. But again, I invite you to search more about the IT jobs and roles that may interest you, and why they would be a good fit for you, besides the potential salary.
              
              Looking at your personal analysis, it is noticeable you are aware of some of your main strengths and weaknesses, this is very good. Your dedication and openness to new connections will come in very handy and useful during your studies, especially with group projects. I recommend you check what may help you handle situations where the outcomes will not be exactly what youll wish them to be, as this will happen especially when studying, doing exams, or working on group tasks. It is good you see the potential as well behind overthinking and not only as negativity, but it could also come handy to find an activity or exercise that will help you calm those extra thoughts for your mental peace. Concerning your fears, please don’t worry about your age, there will be others around the same age, and you will be surprised how easily youll connect with others even if you are of different ages (talking from experience).
              
              I am looking forward to meeting you this coming year and wish you a lovely summer break!
              
              Shirel.
